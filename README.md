## What is LogiSheets?

LogiSheets is a web spreadsheet application that is compatible with Excel and designed for easy further development. Most important of all, it's free! And LogiSheets is written in Rust, and you are able to create, read and write .xlsx files.

## WARNING

LogiSheets is still in the __very__ early stages of development. Your issues or PRs are welcome!


## Design goals

* **Easy further development**: LogiSheets provides rich APIs to help you develop your plugins.
* **Structural Data Support**: LogiSheets provides a data structure (temporary named *Block*) to ensure the relative positions of cells in a certain area keep unchanged.
