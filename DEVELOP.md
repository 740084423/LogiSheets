# LogiSheets Development

We are glad that you are interested in joining our development.

## Concept
`LogiSheets` is a Rust library, a web component or maybe in the future, a co-work supporting product.
We do not attemp to use more names to identify these concepts.
They all are `LogiSheets`.


## Code Management

All the `LogiSheets` related code is in this one repo.
You should have **Rust** and **yarn** installed.
Since we compile the **Rust** code into web assembly, you should have [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/commands/build.html) installed.
